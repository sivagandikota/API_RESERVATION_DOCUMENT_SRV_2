## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instructions given above and execute the following sample Java code to consume an API:

```java

import com.sap.apibhub.sdk.client.*;
import com.sap.apibhub.sdk.client.auth.*;
import com.sap.apibhub.sdk.api_business_partner.model.*;
import com.sap.apibhub.sdk.api_business_partner.api.AAddressEmailAddressApi;

import java.io.File;
import java.util.*;

public class AAddressEmailAddressApiExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
		ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient(); 
		Map<String, Authentication> authentications = defaultClient.getAuthentications();       
		
		//Currently Base Path points to sandbox system, change it to call your API Endpoint
		defaultClient.setBasePath("https://sandbox.api.sap.com/s4hanacloud/sap/opu/odata/sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER");
		//You can obtain your API key on the Settings page of SAP API Business Hub. In the Settings page, choose the Show API Key toggle button to display and copy your API key. You have to be logged in to view your API Key.
		defaultClient.addDefaultHeader("APIKey","<YOUR APIBHUB SANDBOX APIKEY>"); 		
		authentications.put("APIBHUB_SANDBOX_APIKEY", new ApiKeyAuth("header", "APIKey"));
		            
        
		//Change Base Path, uncomment below code and configure Basic Authorization to call your API Endpoint: basicAuthentication
		authentications.put("basicAuthentication", new HttpBasicAuth());
		/*
		HttpBasicAuth basicAuthentication = (HttpBasicAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("basicAuthentication");
		basicAuthentication.setUsername("<YOUR_USERNAME>");
		basicAuthentication.setPassword("<YOUR_PASSWORD>");
		*/		
        AAddressEmailAddressApi apiInstance = new AAddressEmailAddressApi();
        apiInstance.setApiClient(defaultClient);
        String addressID = "addressID_example"; // String | Internal key for identifying a Business Address Services address.   For more information about the meaning and use of the address number and the Business Address Services concepts, see the function group SZA0 documentation.
        String person = "person_example"; // String | Internal key for identifying a person in Business Address Services.   For more information about the meaning and use of the person number and Business Address Services concepts, see the function group SZA0 documentation.
        String ordinalNumber = "ordinalNumber_example"; // String | Sequence Number
        String ifMatch = "ifMatch_example"; // String | ETag
        try {
            apiInstance.aAddressEmailAddressAddressIDAddressIDPersonPersonOrdinalNumberOrdinalNumberDelete(addressID, person, ordinalNumber, ifMatch);
        } catch (ApiException e) {
            System.err.println("Exception when calling AAddressEmailAddressApi#aAddressEmailAddressAddressIDAddressIDPersonPersonOrdinalNumberOrdinalNumberDelete");
            System.err.println("API Response : \n"+e.getResponseBody()); 
        }
    }
}

```

## Documentation for Authorization


Authentication schemes defined for the API:
### basicAuthentication

- **Type**: HTTP basic authentication

 

## Recommendation

It's recommended to create an instance of `ApiClient` per thread in a multithreaded environment to avoid any potential issues.
